"Secret Window, Secret Garden" is one of the novellas in Stephen King's collection titled "Four Past Midnight." This tale delves into the psyche of a writer named Mort Rainey, who is grappling with a messy separation from his wife. The story takes a dark turn when a mysterious man named John Shooter accuses Rainey of plagiarizing his work. As Rainey works to disprove Shooter's accusations, he finds himself facing increasingly violent confrontations with the stranger. As the tension rises and the lines between reality and delusion blur, the tale masterfully unfolds to reveal its chilling climax. King, in his signature style, uses this narrative to explore themes of identity, the fragility of the human mind, and the often tortuous path of the creative process. The novella was later adapted into the movie "Secret Window" starring Johnny Depp, which brought a visual representation of the suspenseful and haunting elements present in the text.
